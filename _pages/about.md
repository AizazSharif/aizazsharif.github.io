I am Aizaz Sharif, a computer Science Major, AI Engineer, and Researcher in Oslo, Norway. As a Machine Learning Engineer at AI Dev Lab, I build end-to-end LLM architectures while previously researching autonomous driving systems at the VIAS department of Simula Research Laboratory and the University of Oslo.

### What I'm Building Now
At AI Dev Lab, I'm implementing a production-ready LLM-powered platform (app.saleskik.ai) for processing daily meeting recordings. This involves:

- Developing custom RAG solutions using LangChain, LangGraph, and Pinecone
- Building robust backend infrastructure with Python, Firebase, and Google Cloud services
- Creating intelligent conversation processing pipelines for context-aware meeting summarization
- Managing the full ML/LLM development lifecycle from prototyping to production

### Scientific Contributions
My doctoral research ([defended](https://www.instagram.com/p/DAiWl7gsxuZ/) on September 2024) focused on "Testing the Safety and Robustness of Autonomous Cars in a Multi-agent Environment," where I made three novel scientific contributions:

- Adversarial reinforcement learning techniques for testing and improving autonomous systems
- Systematic benchmarking methodologies for multi-agent RL driving policies
- Reward modeling frameworks for finding uncertain state space without adversarial training approach

I've created and open-sourced [platforms](https://github.com/T3AS) for testing multi-agent autonomous driving systems, gaining extensive experience with simulated driving environments and reinforcement learning.

Beyond autonomous driving, I have also performed [research](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=luceUvgAAAAJ&hl) in medical imaging, Android security, and software engineering which resulted in multiple publications, including two conference papers and a journal article. This diverse research background has strengthened my ability to apply machine learning techniques across various domains.



### Project Ownership & Team Leadership
I've successfully led teams and managed complex technical projects throughout my career:

- At Simula, I independently managed my entire research portfolio, from literature review to conceptualizing novel ideas, executing experiments, analyzing results, and writing papers - all while working autonomously to deliver high-quality scientific contributions
- At NCCS, I led a team developing a 'Mobile Phone Digital Forensics' toolkit, overseeing the entire project lifecycle from concept to beta testing with authorities
- At AI Dev LAb, I managed end-to-end ML/LLM development workflows and coordinated with cross-functional teams to deliver production-ready AI solutions. I also collaborated directly with clients to understand business requirements and translate them into technical solutions

### Life Outside Code
Outside of my professional life, I enjoy [photography](https://www.instagram.com/aizaz_sharif/) and staying active through cycling, table tennis, and squash. I'm an enthusiastic [Tekken player](https://x.com/AizazSharif420/status/1900526252827582512) trying to compete at a higher [level](https://challonge.com/zedxedan/standings), and occasionally play other games like Rainbow Six Siege when time allows. I have a curiosity for learning about different cultures and collecting random facts. Living in Norway, I'm exploring the country's [beautiful landscapes](https://www.instagram.com/p/CNKWqJVJQxK/) and diverse regions, as well as engaging in [travel photography](https://www.instagram.com/p/B5Tigp6Jqw5/) during my adventures.
